# Password Manager GUI Application
## Goals
1. Allow the user to store the details about their passwords in one place.
2. Easy entry of new data
3. Easy retrieval of passwords

## Features
+ User may store the website name, password, and the email id associated with it, together at once
+ The password generate can generate a strong, random password each time
+ To retrieve the details, just enter the name of the website
+ The application stores the password data in a .json file (automatically created by the program), and is stored in the local drive
+ The program uses the tkinter library to create the GUI

## Additional Points
+ The .json file is NOT password protected anc can be accessed by anyone who has access to the drive
+ You may shift the file to a more secure location. If so, you must update the file path in the code (comments indicate where)
+ The program is not deployable yet. You must copy the code into your code editor and then run it
+ Keep the logo.png file in the same folder as main.py. If you shift the location, be sure to update the file path in the code, as indicated by the comments
